# Game Boy Color USB-C Charging Kit

The **Game Boy Color USB-C Charging Kit** is a circuit that allows you to charge a **Nintendo Game Boy Color** by **USB-C** and use a **Li-ion** battery instead of AA batteries.

This circuit includes the famous **TP4056** and **DW01A**. The first one is the device in charge of charging the battery, and the second one is protecting the lifetime of the battery of the over-discharge.

This kit includes two boards. If you want to install it easy, it's enough with the main board which doesn't need any cable for working. However, if you want to have the status LEDs in the same place as the original status LED, then you will need to solder the second board and joint both with 3 cables. You can choose the best option for you.

This is the maind board:
